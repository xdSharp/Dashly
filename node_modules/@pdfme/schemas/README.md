## @pdfme/schemas

This library provides schemas for pdfme templates.  
The currently supported schemas can be found in [this document](https://pdfme.com/docs/supported-features).

These schemas are used as plugins in [@pdfme/ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pdfme/ui) and [@pdfme/generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pdfme/generator), where they are interpreted by UI components and the PDF generator.
